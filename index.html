        <p>This is a photo of the micro-cutting tool of 0.03mm diameter and 0.05mm length. 
          The small gear is made by the cutting mechnically with this tool.
          The tool turns about 10,000 r.p.m..

        <p>This is the micro-cutting system with an electromgnetic levition stage. 
          The black rectangular body is the electromagnetic levitation stage made of steel. The red body is the spindle mortor. 
          By moving the workpiece on the top of the stage, the micro-cutting tool, fixed into the spindle mortor's rotor, produces the shape.</p>

        <p>This is the internal structure of the electromgnetic levition Stage. The dark painted object is the stage. 
          The objects symbolized as "EM" are electromagnets, which attract the stage by electromagnetic forces. 
          The electromagnets EM1-3 levitate the stage vertically against gravity. 
          The electromagnets EM4-6 have symbols "P" and "N", which indicate the positive and negative way respectively. 
          So, the conbination of the 2 electromagnets symbolized as "P" and "N" generates a holizontal force of both positive and negative way of one direction.
          The cylindrical objects symbolized as "S" are gap sensors.</p>
