        <p>This is the micro-cutting system with an electromgnetic levition stage. 
          The black rectangular body is the electromagnetic levitation stage. The red body is the spindle mortor. 
          By moving the workpiece on the top of the stage, the micro-cutting tool, fixed into the spindle mortor, produces the shape.</p>

        <p>This is the internal structure of the electromgnetic levition Stage. The dark painted object is the stage. 
          The objects symbolized as "EM" are electromagnets, which attract the stage by electromagnetic forces. 
          The symbols "P" and "N" indicate the positive way and negative way respectively. 
          So, the conbination of the 2 electromagnets symbolized "P" and "N" generates a force of both positive and negative way of one direction.
          The cylindrical objects symbolized as "S" are gap sensors.</p>
