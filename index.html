        <p>This is a steel submili-gear whose diameter is 0.5 mm and thickness is 0.05mm. The number of the teeth is 20. 
          The black bar is a mechanical pencil lead with a  diameter of 0.5mm. How can you make such a small gear?</p>

        <p>This is a photo of the micro-cutting rotary tool of 0.03mm diameter and 0.05mm length. 
          These kinds of very small tools are generally sold.
          The small gear is made by the cutting mechanically with this tool.
          The tool rotates at about 10,000 rpm.

        <p>This is the micromachining system with an electromagnetic levitation stage. 
          The black rectangular body is the electromagnetic levitation stage made of steel. 
          The red body is the spindle mill. 
          By moving the workpiece on the top of the stage, the micromachining tool, 
          which is fixed in the rotor of the spindle, makes the shape.</p>

        <p>This is the photo of the stage that is placed inside the the body of the frame. 
          It is levitated by electromagnetic forces. 
          The workpiece to be machined is placed on the top of the stage. 
          The moving strokes of the stage are 1mm for horizontal directions and 0.5mm for vertical direction. 
          The positioning resolution is 0.2μm.</p>

        <p>This picture shows the internal structure of the electromagnetic levitation stage. 
          The dark colored  object is the stage. 
          The objects labeled "EM" are electromagnets, that attract the stage by electromagnetic forces. 
          Electromagnets EM1-3 levitate the stage vertically(z) against gravity. 
          The electromagnets EM4-6 have the suffix "P" and "N", indicating the positive way and the negative way respectively. 
          Thus, a pair of the 2 electromagnets labeled "P" and "N" generates a horizontal(x-y) force of both positive and negative way of one direction.
          The cylindrical objects labeled "S" are gap sensors.</p>
